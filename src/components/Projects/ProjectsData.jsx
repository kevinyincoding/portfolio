        description: "Old School RuneScape is a game where keeping track of statistics is very important. However, there is a flaw in its API which does not allow a certain subset of accounts to have their data tracked. This project tries to remedy that by scraping related data from the official website and API, and using that to reconstruct a dataset for this subset of accounts.",
